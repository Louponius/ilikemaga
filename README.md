# The original ilikema.ga
## Yes, from the actual hard drive.

story of ilikema.ga:

When Sam and I were friends, we created silly little websites
and we decided to work together to make the best of silly websites
these were all stored inside ilikema.ga

The server was a HP ProLiant Microserver Gen 8th which I got from one
of my dad's friends, apparently he didn't need it so he gave it to me.

And the website was... uh... online occasionally, it went offline quite a lot
and I remember in July 2020 getting frustrated trying to fix it with Sam.

And then sometime soon it broke, the microserver didn't work but the hard
drives were not damaged, so I hooked the drive to my PC and it worked like a charm!

I was able to boot Lubuntu and i remembered the password! Horray!
so I archived everything from /var, /etc and /home. but I won't show those files
I will show /var/www/html which was the website itself.

PS: I had to delete a file which was a copyrighted file. I apparently didn't care about copyright when I was younger? it's gone now obviously, I wouldn't want MSNBC or whatever company owned the rights to it to sue me lol.

PSS: Also the movie was 500+ MB so I couldn't store it, not even with Git LFS. Lol.

# Is this abandoned?
## Yes!

This project will be forever abandoned unless Sparksammy wants to revive it again along with me, if he wants to then we will keep track of everything in Git and publish it regularly.

But it probably still won't happen since I, the original hoster don't have a lot of resources to do it, also I am just not that interested anymore.

But I still want to revive it because it was so fun a long time ago.
Now it's just a historical memory stored on my USB
and on Github for the entire world to see...
